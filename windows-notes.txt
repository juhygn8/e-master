= Introduction =

This document describes how to build e & its dependencies.

To build e you will need:

* A copy of Visual C++ 2008
** You can get the free express edition at http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/
** Full Visual Studio versions also work fine.
** Make sure you have VS2008 SP1 and any applicable Vista-related hot-fixes.

* A set of GNU tools for Windows (including bash, patch, wget, etc.)
** Cygwin is used by e itself to provide Unix support, but has issues on 
   64-bit versions of Windows.
** If you're building from source on Windows, you're probably using MSysGit
** Either of these packages will provide GNU tools, but will have different issues 
   and workarounds. See `externals/readme.txt` for more information.


= Building the Dependencies =

e's dependencies are:
* wxWidgets
* Metakit
* PCRE
* libcurl
* libtommath
* libtomcrypt
* TinyXML


To download, patch and compile these dependencies:
* Run "get_externals_win.sh" in a bash shell (Cygwin or MSysGit)
* Run "build_externals_win.cmd" in a VS2008 Command Prompt.

Later versions of these projects may work with e, but have not been tested.
Consult the "get_externals_win.sh" script to see what the expected versions are.


= Building e Itself =

* After building all the dependencies, open "e.sln" and build the Debug target.
* The newly build "e" will use configuration in the registry from an installed
  license or trial version.
